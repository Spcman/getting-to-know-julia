Hello World!

This static website is hosted for free on [GitHub Pages with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll)

The posts and pages are markdown files (.md) which makes them quick to compose.  The super cool thing is that you can save your Notebooks as markdown files from Jupyter and the output file only requires a small amount of editing to make it look good on the Jekyll website. 

Big shout out to Michael Rose for the theme [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) and DataOptimal who made this video on how to get started and put everything together.

To get the math equations looking good I use [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in the markdown.
