Hello, I’m Nigel Adams, sometimes known as Spaceman.

I live in Brisbane Australia and work as an XPLAN developer in the financial services sector.

I’ve been into tech pretty much all my life and have been studying Machine Learning in my own time since December 2017.

My friend introduced me to Julia at the start of 2019 and I’ve been hooked ever-since.
