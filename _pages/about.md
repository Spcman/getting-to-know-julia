Hello, I’m Nigel Adams, sometimes known as Spaceman.

I live in Brisbane Australia and work as an XPLAN developer in the financial services sector.

I’ve been into tech pretty much all my life and have been studying Machine Learning in my own time since December 2017.

My friend introduced me to the Julia programming language at the start of 2019 and I’ve been hooked ever-since.

>Julia combines the ease of use of quantitative environments such as Python and R with the speed of production programming languages such as C++ and Java. Julia can be 10-100x faster than its cohorts.
