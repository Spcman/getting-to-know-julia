Machine Learning is subset of the field of Artificial Intelligence where computer systems are used to perform a specific task without given explicit instructions.  

>The main concept to grasp with machine learning you don’t define the rules, instead you give the machine learning algorithms lots of examples and it learns how to do the task on it’s own.

Here’s a picture to help explain where machine learning lies with relation to other terms you’ve possibly heard of.

## What is machine learning is used for?

Here are just a few application of machine learning.

+ **Vision** - Facial recognition, medical diagnosis, self-driving cars
+ **Audio** - Speech recognition, personal digital assistants
+ **Recommendation Systems** – Retail (think of Amazon) Streaming (think of Netflix) and other targeted advertising (e.g. Google search)
+ **Text Analysis** - Processing claims, paralegal research, medical diagnosis

Machine learning can be used for any application where there is sufficient data to learn from. We’re now living in an age where digital data is being collected in abundance, computing power is fast and just getting faster.  A huge boost is coming from the tech giants and start-ups who are all investing heavily in this field. The academic world is also going data-science crazy with many new students learning this field and writing new papers.

Not that long ago some scientists thought a computer could never distinguish images of cats from dogs and now this is considered pretty trivial. With YOLO you can detect multiple objects in real-time.

This example show’s an AI assistant booking an appointment and having a ‘real’ conversation.

## Where are we heading?

Like it or not AI is going to have more and more impact on our daily lives. Respected thinkers liken the changes to a 'second industrial revolution' or a 'new electricity'. This time, however, the white-collar and professional workers may be more affected.  In the medical industry we’re already seeing that AI is better than humans a detecting cancer from images. It’s likely that more general medical diagnosis will be better via AI in the not too distant future. The legal sector is also likely to be affected as tasks done by paralegals will soon be done really well using AI too … and this is just the start.

AI has proved ‘better’ than human intelligence at a number of tasks most famously at the game of Go.  The story behind Move 37 is quite fascinating.

Although AI can already be ‘better’ than humans at a number of tasks it is still limited to the individual tasks that it has been trained to do.  Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a term used to describe a machine that has the capacity to learn any intellectual task that a human can do. When invented this will be the tipping point of something really big! It’s anticipated that such a machine would quickly learn to be more intelligent that humans having a status of ‘superintelligent’. It’s something that troubles many scientists as there is no limit on intelligence and what that that might mean.  Nobody knows how far this is actually away but it could less than 60 years away....

## The dark side of AI

Aside from the obvious ‘Terminator’ scenario, deep fakes videos are relatively easy to make right now.

These videos are not restricted to World leaders, soon someone could be impersonating you!

## Machine learning must be easy?

Unfortunately, not quite, well at least not yet!

Getting the models to work requires a fair bit of skill and experimentation. As a machine learning practitioner you really need to be able to write code to run ‘experiments’.  You’ll ideally need to have a good grasp of math too; in particular the areas of linear algebra, statistics, pobability and calculus.  There are also many algorithms, terms, languages, libraries to choose from and to know how to use properly. If you have an idea for a machine learning project sometimes data may also become a barrier.  Accurate models generally need many training data examples to learn the task.  For most applications you’ll need over a 500 labelled examples in a data set for a decent prediction accuracy.

...But learning AI is certainly doable and once you get started it’s a real positive addiction to see what you can learn and do!

About the math! Don’t be put off by this, you can get started and build pretty amazing models without knowing much math at all.  Start at the top and work down to the math later if you like.

## Machine Learning in my business

I recently stumbled on this talk by Andrew Ng.  I did his brilliant course on Machine Learning a while ago.  He explains how now may be the time to try out some use-cases in your own business.
